# Setting up a Live Server with NodeJS

The NodeJS live-server package runs a temporary server displaying any HTML/CSS/JS resources in the current folder. It automatically reloads the page in your browser when any of these files change.

-   Verify that Node.js is installed. If you see anything when you run `npm -v` in a terminal, it is. If not, follow the instructions at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install.
-   Install live-server: `npm install -g live-server`
-   Move your terminal to where your pages live: `cd <path-to-project>`
-   Start the server: `live-server .`
-   Open [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in a browser.
